    "Disc galaxies have a negative exponential surface brightness profile as described by Equation \\ref{eq1}, where '$a$' is the scale length of the disc. These galaxies are often reasonably smooth in the azimuthal coordinate '$\\phi$', with low-order multiplicity '$m$' and can be described by Fourier Series. \n",

    "In the radial '$R$' coordinate, Laguerre basis functions, as shown in Equation \\ref{eq2}, are utilised as the exponential term closely approximates to the exponential profile of a typical disc galaxy (Equation \\ref{eq1}). Here, in Equation \\ref{eq2}, '$L_n^1$' is the associated Laguerre polynomial of order '$\\alpha=1$' and degree '$n$', and '$a$' is the expansion scale length.\n",

    "Hence, Fourier-Laguerre basis functions can accurately model the surface brightness profile of discs in 2 dimensions. '$G_n(R)\\cos{m\\phi}$' and '$G_n(R)\\sin{m\\phi}$', known as Fourier-Laguerre functions, comprise of coefficients $\\hat{c}_{mn}$ and $\\hat{s}_{mn}$, that are naturally determined by the projection of the surface density, $\\Sigma(R,\\phi)$, into the basis functions. These coefficients are calculated as shown in Equation \\ref{eq3}, where $(R_{xy},\\phi_{xy})$ is the polar position of pixel $(x,y)$. It's worth noting here that discretion summations are used over continuous integrals as our model is accumulating discrete pixels in $(x,y)$. \n",
